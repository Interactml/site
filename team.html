            <span class="image left"><img src="images/rebecca.jpg" alt="" /></span>
            <p>I am a Reader at the Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts London. My students, research assistants, and I work on a variety of projects developing new technologies to enable new forms of human expression, creativity, and embodied interaction. Much of my current research combines techniques from human-computer interaction, machine learning, and signal processing to allow people to apply machine learning more effectively to new problems, such as the design of new digital musical instruments and gestural interfaces for gaming and accessibility. I am also involved in projects developing rich interactive technologies for digital humanities scholarship, and machine learning education.</p></br></br></br>

            <p>Marco Gillies is Principal Investigator on the 4i Project. Marco’s research centres on how we can create technologies that work with embodied, tacit human knowledge. He has many years’ experience of research into how to generate non-verbal communication for animated virtual characters, particularly for social interaction in virtual reality. His approach focuses on the role actors and performers can play in creating autonomous characters.He has also worked on other forms of immersive experience and embodied interaction, particularly applied to immersive theatre and performance. His recent research has been on human-centred machine learning in which humans guide machine learning algorithms interactively as a way of making use of tacit human knowledge in artificial intelligence systems.</p></br></br></br>

            <h2>Carlos Gonzalez Diaz</h2>
            <span class="image left"><img src="images/carlos.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>I am a PhD Candidate at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI) at the University of York, Goldsmiths and Queen Mary universities. I am passionate about science and coding, and I developed games and tech in the UK, Sweden and Spain. I am interested in understanding how the use of interactive machine learning in the design of movement interactions of virtual reality games can affect the player experience. I was previously an intern at Sony Interactive Entertainment R&D researching on the PSVR game system. After that, I jumped to this project and architected the first version of InteractML. Currently I am working with the rest of team on further developing InteractML and exploring its possibilities.</p></br></br></br>

            <p>Michael Zbyszyński is a lecturer in the Department of Computing, where he teaches perception & multimedia computing, live electroacoustic music, and real-time interaction. His research involves applications of interactive machine learning to musical instrument design and performance. As a musician, his work spans from brass bands to symphony orchestras, including composition and improvisation with woodwinds and electronics. He has been a software developer at Avid, SoundHound, Cycling ’74, and Keith McMillen Instruments, and was Assistant Director of Pedagogy at UC Berkeley’s Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT). He holds a PhD from UC Berkeley and studied at the Academy of Music in Kraków on a Fulbright Grant. His work has been included in Make Magazine, the Rhizome Artbase, and on the ARTSHIP recording label.</p></br></br></br>
