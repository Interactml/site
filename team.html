            <p>I am a Reader at the Creative Computing Institute at University of the Arts London. My students, research assistants, and I work on a variety of projects developing new technologies to enable new forms of human expression, creativity, and embodied interaction. Much of my current research combines techniques from human-computer interaction, machine learning, and signal processing to allow people to apply machine learning more effectively to new problems, such as the design of new digital musical instruments and gestural interfaces for gaming and accessibility. I am also involved in projects developing rich interactive technologies for digital humanities scholarship, and machine learning education.</p></br></br></br>

            <span class="image left"><img src="images/carlos.jpg" alt="" /></span>I am a PhD Candidate at the Centre for Doctoral Training in Intelligent Games and Games Intelligence (IGGI) between 4 leading UK universities. I am a passionate coder and I developed games and tech in the UK, Sweden and Spain. I am interested in understanding how bringing AI into VR/AR and other sensor-based technologies affects the player experience. I worked as a research assistant for the two amazing women in this project and architected InteractML.</br></br></br>
